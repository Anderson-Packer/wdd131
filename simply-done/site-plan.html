			<h3>About Page</h3>
			<p>
                Using a to-do list is one of the simplest and most effective ways to stay organized. It helps you clearly see what needs to get done, prioritize important tasks, and avoid forgetting responsibilities throughout the day. A good to-do list reduces stress by breaking work into manageable steps and giving you a sense of progress as you check things off. Whether you're planning a busy day or just keeping track of small errands, a to-do list helps you stay focused, productive, and in control.
